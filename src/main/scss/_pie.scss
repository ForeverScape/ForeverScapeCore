// this file demonstrates how to use the CSS PIE extension for
// legacy versions of Internet Explorer. In many cases, PIE will allow
// you to style in CSS things that you'd have to do using image chops otherwise.
//
// Note: Each element that has PIE enabled on it will add about 10ms to your page load.
@import "compass/css3/pie";


// Set this to wherever you end up putting your behavior file.
//
// **Note:** this file must be served as a root-relative resource or
// else IE will interpret it as relative to the current webpage
// instead of the stylesheet.
//
// **Also Note:** this file must be delivered with a mime-type of:
//
//    text/x-component
